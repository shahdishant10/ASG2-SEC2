# ASG2-SEC2
**This file contains the header file, source file, readme file and output screenshot of the code for CS-700 ASSIGNMENT 2 SECTION 2.**

HEADER FILE\n
The header file contains two functions:-
1. verifying_cos_fun : - This function basically checks whether the given value is same as expected cosine or different.
                       - It consist of two parameter, the first one is the integer z and the second one is the integer expect.
                       - This function has no return type.
2. verfying_sin_fun : - This function basically checks whether the given value is same as expected sine value or different.
                      - It consist of two parameter, the first one is the integer z and the second one is the integer expect.
                      - This function has no return type.

SOURCE FILE\n
The source file just contains calling of the functions declared in the header file and checking the cos and sin fucntion for the values on the border line, between the boundary and close to the boundary values.
